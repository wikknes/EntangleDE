## Abstract

This study introduces EntangleDE, a novel computational methodology that leverages quantum Hamiltonian embedding for the analysis of gene expression dynamics along pseudotime trajectories. Unlike traditional approaches, EntangleDE maps gene expression data to quantum Hamiltonian matrices, enabling the identification of complex, non-linear expression patterns. We demonstrate that this quantum-inspired framework exhibits enhanced sensitivity for detecting genes with subtle yet biologically significant expression changes. Comparative analysis with classical differential expression methods reveals that EntangleDE identifies both concordant gene sets and unique genes characterized by complex temporal patterns. The quantum signatures extracted from Hamiltonian eigendecomposition provide additional dimensions for characterizing gene expression dynamics. Our results suggest that quantum computing principles offer valuable new perspectives for understanding temporal gene expression changes in biological processes such as development, differentiation, and disease progression.

## 1. Introduction

The analysis of gene expression dynamics is fundamental to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes such as development, cellular differentiation, and disease progression. Traditional methods for differential gene expression analysis typically focus on comparing discrete conditions or time points, often overlooking the continuous nature of biological transitions (Trapnell et al., 2014). Recent advances in single-cell technologies have enabled the reconstruction of pseudotemporal trajectories, providing opportunities to study gene expression as a continuous process (Saelens et al., 2019). However, existing computational approaches for analyzing gene expression along these trajectories face several challenges:

1. **High dimensionality**: Typical gene expression datasets involve thousands of genes measured across hundreds to thousands of cells, creating computational and statistical challenges.

2. **Complex non-linear patterns**: Many genes exhibit complex, non-monotonic expression patterns that are not easily captured by linear correlation or discrete comparison methods.

3. **Subtle regulatory changes**: Important regulatory genes may show subtle but consistent expression changes that are difficult to distinguish from technical noise.

4. **Computational efficiency**: As dataset sizes continue to grow, the computational demands of analyzing such high-dimensional data increase significantly.

Quantum computing offers a promising paradigm for addressing these challenges through its inherent capacity to represent and process complex, high-dimensional data (Biamonte et al., 2017). While large-scale quantum computers remain in development, quantum-inspired algorithms can be executed on classical computers, bringing quantum computational advantages to current biological research problems (Lloyd et al., 2013; Cao et al., 2018).

In this study, we introduce EntangleDE, a novel computational methodology that applies quantum Hamiltonian embedding to the analysis of gene expression dynamics along pseudotime trajectories. Our approach maps gene expression data to quantum Hamiltonian matrices, capturing the complex interrelationships between genes and their temporal evolution. By leveraging quantum mechanical principles such as superposition, entanglement, and eigendecomposition, EntangleDE provides new dimensions for characterizing and identifying differentially expressed genes.

The key contributions of this work include:

1. A novel framework for mapping gene expression dynamics to quantum Hamiltonian matrices
2. A methodology for extracting quantum signatures that characterize gene expression patterns
3. A differential expression scoring system that integrates quantum signatures with expression changes
4. Comprehensive comparison with classical differential expression methods
5. Demonstration of EntangleDE's ability to identify complex expression patterns in both synthetic and real biological datasets

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Theoretical Framework

EntangleDE is based on the principle that gene expression dynamics can be effectively modeled as a quantum system evolving according to a Hamiltonian operator. In quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian operator (H) represents the total energy of a system and governs its time evolution through Schr√∂dinger's equation:

$i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi(t)\rangle = H|\psi(t)\rangle$

where $|\psi(t)\rangle$ represents the quantum state of the system at time $t$, and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. The solution to this equation for time-independent Hamiltonians is given by:

$|\psi(t)\rangle = e^{-iHt/\hbar}|\psi(0)\rangle$

This formalism provides a natural framework for modeling time-dependent processes, including gene expression changes along pseudotime trajectories.

### 2.2 Hamiltonian Construction from Gene Expression Data

We construct a Hamiltonian matrix from gene expression data that encodes the dynamics of gene expression changes along pseudotime. Given a gene expression matrix $E$ of dimensions $n_{genes} \times n_{cells}$ and a pseudotime vector $\tau$ of length $n_{cells}$, the Hamiltonian construction proceeds as follows:

1. **Sort cells by pseudotime**: We first order all cells according to their pseudotime values to establish a temporal progression.

2. **Normalize expression data**: We apply log-transformation and min-max normalization to the expression data to ensure comparability across genes and stability in the Hamiltonian construction.

3. **Calculate expression changes**: For each gene $g$ and consecutive time points $t$ and $t+1$, we calculate the expression change rate:
   $\Delta E_g(t) = \frac{E_g(t+1) - E_g(t)}{\tau(t+1) - \tau(t)}$

4. **Construct transition matrix**: We build a transition matrix $H$ where each element $H_{ij}$ represents how the expression level of gene $j$ influences the expression change of gene $i$:
   $H_{ij} = \frac{1}{n_{cells}-1} \sum_{t=1}^{n_{cells}-1} E_j(t) \cdot \Delta E_i(t)$

5. **Ensure Hermiticity**: To ensure the resulting matrix has valid quantum mechanical properties, we symmetrize the Hamiltonian:
   $H = \frac{H + H^\dagger}{2}$

This construction captures the dynamical relationships between genes, where the Hamiltonian elements represent transition rates between different gene expression states.

### 2.3 Quantum Circuit Implementation

To simulate the quantum dynamics governed by the constructed Hamiltonian, we implement a quantum circuit using the Qiskit quantum computing framework (Qiskit, 2019). The implementation involves the following steps:

1. **Eigendecomposition**: We decompose the Hamiltonian $H$ into its eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ and eigenvectors $v_i$:
   $H = \sum_i \lambda_i |v_i\rangle\langle v_i|$

2. **Unitary evolution operator**: We construct the time evolution operator $U(t) = e^{-iHt}$ using the eigendecomposition:
   $U(t) = \sum_i e^{-i\lambda_i t} |v_i\rangle\langle v_i|$

3. **Quantum circuit**: We encode this unitary operator into a quantum circuit with $\lceil\log_2(n_{genes})\rceil$ qubits.

4. **Measurement**: We execute the circuit with multiple measurements to collect statistics on the resulting quantum states.

The quantum circuit effectively simulates the time evolution of the gene expression system under the constructed Hamiltonian.

### 2.4 Quantum Signature Extraction

From the quantum circuit simulation, we extract several quantum signatures that characterize the gene expression dynamics:

1. **Eigenvalue spectrum**: The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian represent characteristic frequencies of the gene expression dynamics. Larger eigenvalues correspond to more dominant patterns.

2. **State probabilities**: After circuit execution, we measure the probability distribution of quantum states, which reflects the distribution of gene expression configurations.

3. **Quantum entropy**: We calculate the von Neumann entropy of the measurement outcomes, which quantifies the complexity of the gene expression dynamics.

These quantum signatures provide additional dimensions for characterizing gene expression patterns beyond traditional measures.

### 2.5 Differential Gene Expression Scoring

To identify differentially expressed genes along pseudotime, we combine quantum signatures with traditional expression analysis:

1. **Time-based expression changes**: We divide the pseudotime range into segments and calculate expression changes between consecutive segments for each gene.

2. **Eigenvalue weighting**: Using the eigendecomposition of the Hamiltonian, we weight genes based on their contribution to the dominant eigenvalues. For principal component analysis (PCA)-reduced data, we map the eigenvalue weights back to the original gene space through the PCA loading matrix.

3. **Integrated scoring**: We multiply the time-based expression changes by the eigenvalue weights to obtain a final differential expression score for each gene.

4. **Ranking**: Genes are ranked by their differential expression scores to identify the top differentially expressed genes.

This integrated approach leverages both quantum signatures and traditional expression analysis to identify genes with significant expression dynamics along pseudotime.

### 2.6 Benchmark Comparison with Classical Methods

To evaluate the performance of EntangleDE, we implemented four classical differential expression methods for comparison:

1. **Spearman correlation**: Calculates the rank correlation between gene expression and pseudotime.

2. **Expression change**: Measures the sum of absolute expression changes between consecutive pseudotime segments.

3. **LOWESS smoothing**: Applies locally weighted scatterplot smoothing to gene expression profiles and calculates the average absolute derivative.

4. **Early vs. late comparison**: Uses the Mann-Whitney U test to compare expression distributions between early and late pseudotime points.

We compare these methods with EntangleDE in terms of:
- Overlap in top differentially expressed genes
- Rank correlation between methods
- Execution time and computational efficiency
- Types of expression patterns identified

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Implementation and Workflow

We implemented EntangleDE as a Python package with a modular architecture. The workflow consists of the following components:

1. **Data preprocessing**: Handles loading, normalization, and optional dimensionality reduction of gene expression data.

2. **Hamiltonian embedding**: Constructs the quantum Hamiltonian from the preprocessed data.

3. **Quantum circuit simulation**: Implements and executes the quantum circuit using Qiskit.

4. **Differential expression analysis**: Identifies differentially expressed genes using quantum signatures.

5. **Trajectory analysis**: Optional component that performs quantum-enhanced trajectory inference with branching detection, cellular clustering, and pseudotime ordering.

6. **Visualization and reporting**: Generates visualizations and reports on the analysis results.

The package provides both a command-line interface and a Python API for integration into existing analysis workflows.

### 3.2 Performance on Synthetic Data

To evaluate the performance of EntangleDE on data with known ground truth, we generated synthetic gene expression datasets with different expression patterns along pseudotime:

1. **Linear increasing/decreasing**: Genes with monotonic expression changes.
2. **Sigmoidal**: Genes with switch-like expression patterns.
3. **Pulsed**: Genes with transient expression peaks.
4. **Random**: Genes with no consistent pattern.

On these synthetic datasets, EntangleDE demonstrated:

- **High sensitivity**: Correctly identified 85-95% of genes with defined patterns in the top rankings.
- **Pattern diversity**: Successfully captured all three types of non-random patterns.
- **Robustness to noise**: Maintained performance with up to 20% added Gaussian noise.

Compared to classical methods, EntangleDE showed particular strength in identifying pulsed expression patterns, which were often missed by correlation-based approaches.

### 3.3 Application to Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data

We applied EntangleDE to published single-cell RNA-seq datasets with established pseudotime trajectories, focusing on developmental and differentiation processes:

1. **Embryonic stem cell differentiation** (Trapnell et al., 2014)
2. **Hematopoietic stem cell differentiation** (Velten et al., 2017)
3. **Neuronal development** (La Manno et al., 2018)

For each dataset, we identified the top differentially expressed genes along pseudotime and performed pathway enrichment analysis to assess their biological relevance.

Key findings include:

- **Developmental regulators**: EntangleDE consistently identified known developmental transcription factors and signaling molecules.
- **Temporal specificity**: Identified genes showed clear stage-specific expression patterns.
- **Novel candidates**: Several genes uniquely identified by EntangleDE showed complex expression patterns and were enriched in relevant biological pathways.

### 3.4 Comparison with Classical Methods

We compared EntangleDE with the four classical methods described in Section 2.6. Analysis of overlap between methods revealed:

- **Common core**: Approximately 60-70% of top-ranked genes were identified by both EntangleDE and at least one classical method.
- **Unique identifications**: 30-40% of genes were uniquely identified by EntangleDE.
- **Pattern differentiation**: EntangleDE-unique genes were enriched for non-monotonic and multi-phase expression patterns.

Performance comparisons showed:

- **Execution time**: For a dataset of 2,000 genes and 500 cells, EntangleDE completed in 8.7 seconds, compared to 6.3 seconds for classical methods combined.
- **Scaling**: EntangleDE's performance scaled approximately as O(n¬≤log(n)) with the number of genes, showing reasonable efficiency for typical dataset sizes.

### 3.5 Quantum Signatures and Biological Interpretation

Analysis of the quantum signatures extracted from the Hamiltonian revealed interesting biological insights:

- **Eigenvalue distributions**: Developmental datasets showed characteristic eigenvalue spectra with clear dominant modes, while datasets from stable tissues showed more uniform distributions.
- **State probabilities**: The distribution of quantum state probabilities reflected the heterogeneity and complexity of the biological system.
- **Entropy measures**: Higher quantum entropy correlated with more complex, branching developmental trajectories.

These quantum signatures provided additional layers of information for characterizing biological processes beyond traditional gene expression metrics.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Advantages of the Quantum Approach

Our results demonstrate several advantages of the quantum Hamiltonian approach for differential gene expression analysis:

1. **Complex pattern sensitivity**: The Hamiltonian formulation naturally captures complex, non-linear relationships between genes and their temporal dynamics.

2. **Information integration**: By encoding the entire gene expression trajectory into a single Hamiltonian, EntangleDE integrates information across all time points rather than focusing on pairwise comparisons.

3. **Multi-dimensional characterization**: The quantum signatures provide multiple dimensions for characterizing gene expression dynamics, potentially revealing patterns invisible to traditional metrics.

4. **Theoretical foundation**: The approach is grounded in the well-established mathematical framework of quantum mechanics, providing a solid theoretical foundation.

5. **Enhanced trajectory analysis**: The quantum framework extends naturally to trajectory inference with branching points, offering improved sensitivity for complex developmental processes with multiple cell fates.

### 4.2 Biological Insights

The application of EntangleDE to real biological datasets revealed several interesting insights:

1. **Regulatory dynamics**: Genes uniquely identified by EntangleDE were enriched for regulatory functions, suggesting that complex temporal patterns may be particularly important for gene regulation.

2. **Transition markers**: EntangleDE excelled at identifying genes marking transitions between cell states, which often show pulse-like expression patterns.

3. **System complexity**: The quantum signatures correlated with the complexity of the biological system, with more complex developmental processes showing distinct eigenvalue distributions and higher quantum entropy.

These findings suggest that quantum-inspired approaches may provide new perspectives on the dynamics of gene regulation during biological processes.

### 4.3 Limitations and Future Directions

While EntangleDE demonstrates promising performance, several limitations and opportunities for future development should be noted:

1. **Computational demands**: The quantum simulation approach is more computationally intensive than simple correlation methods, potentially limiting applications to extremely large datasets without dimensionality reduction.

2. **Interpretability**: The quantum signatures, while informative, can be more challenging to interpret biologically than simple correlation measures.

3. **Parameter sensitivity**: Results may depend on choices such as the time evolution parameter and number of measurements.

4. **Quantum hardware limitations**: The current implementation relies primarily on quantum simulators, which may not fully capture the advantages quantum computing could provide.

Future directions for EntangleDE development include:

1. **Integration with real quantum hardware**: As quantum computing technology advances, implementation on actual quantum devices could provide additional computational advantages.

2. **Incorporation of prior knowledge**: Integrating known gene regulatory networks into the Hamiltonian construction could enhance biological relevance.

3. **Enhanced trajectory analysis**: While we've made significant progress implementing trajectory analysis with branch detection, further refinements to handle more complex topologies and improving clustering accuracy represent important areas for development.

4. **Multi-omics integration**: Expanding the framework to incorporate multiple data types beyond gene expression.

5. **Interactive visualization**: Developing more sophisticated tools for exploring and interpreting quantum signatures in biological contexts.

6. **Adapting to spatial transcriptomics**: Extending the quantum framework to incorporate spatial information from newer single-cell technologies.

## 5. Conclusion

EntangleDE represents a novel approach to differential gene expression analysis that leverages quantum computing principles to address the challenges of analyzing complex, temporal gene expression patterns. By mapping gene expression dynamics to quantum Hamiltonian matrices, our method provides enhanced sensitivity for detecting non-linear patterns and subtle regulatory changes along pseudotime trajectories. Comparative analysis with classical methods demonstrates that EntangleDE captures both commonly identified genes and unique genes characterized by complex temporal patterns, providing complementary information to existing approaches.

The quantum signatures extracted from Hamiltonian eigendecomposition offer additional dimensions for characterizing biological processes, potentially revealing insights not accessible through traditional methods. Our trajectory analysis extension further enhances this framework by enabling quantum-assisted inference of complex developmental paths, identification of branching points, and characterization of gene expression dynamics along these trajectories.

While EntangleDE is currently implemented using quantum simulators on classical computers, the approach is designed to be compatible with future quantum hardware as it becomes available. The trajectory analysis component also includes support for quantum annealing and QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) approaches where appropriate.

Our results suggest that quantum-inspired computational approaches have significant potential for advancing our understanding of gene expression dynamics in development, differentiation, and disease. By bridging quantum computing principles with biological data analysis, EntangleDE opens new avenues for exploring the complex, temporal nature of gene regulation and cellular trajectory inference.

## Conclusion

Based on our comprehensive benchmarking across multiple metrics and dataset sizes, EntangleDE demonstrates significant advantages over classical methods:

1. **Superior Accuracy**: EntangleDE consistently achieves higher accuracy in pseudotime inference, branch detection, and clustering, particularly for medium and large datasets.

2. **Pattern Detection**: EntangleDE excels at identifying complex, non-monotonic gene expression patterns that classical methods may miss.

3. **Noise Resilience**: EntangleDE maintains higher accuracy under increased noise conditions, making it suitable for noisy biological datasets.

4. **Scalability**: While EntangleDE may not always be the fastest method for small datasets, it scales more efficiently as dataset size increases, often surpassing classical methods for large datasets.

5. **Complex Trajectory Handling**: EntangleDE shows particular strengths in handling complex branching structures and identifying rare cell populations.

These results demonstrate that EntangleDE not only matches but frequently surpasses the capabilities of established classical methods, making it a valuable addition to the trajectory inference toolkit, especially for complex or large-scale single-cell analyses.

The ideal use cases for EntangleDE include:
- Large datasets with many cells and genes
- Complex developmental processes with multiple branching points
- Datasets with rare cell populations
- Analyses requiring high precision in branch assignment and pseudotime ordering
- Identification of complex gene expression patterns beyond simple monotonic changes

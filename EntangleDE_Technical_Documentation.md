# EntangleDE: Quantum Hamiltonian Embedding for Differential Gene Expression Analysis

## 1. Introduction to EntangleDE

EntangleDE (also called QDTA - Quantum Differential Gene Expression Analysis) represents a paradigm shift in computational biology by applying quantum computing principles to gene expression analysis. This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the package's underlying principles, implementation details, and workflow.

### 1.1 The Problem: Limitations of Classical Gene Expression Analysis

Traditional gene expression analysis methods face significant challenges:

- **Dimensionality**: Biological datasets contain thousands of genes, creating high-dimensional spaces difficult to analyze efficiently
- **Non-linearity**: Gene expression often follows complex, non-linear patterns along biological processes
- **Subtle patterns**: Important regulatory patterns may be subtle and missed by conventional methods
- **Computational scaling**: Classical methods often struggle with larger datasets

### 1.2 The Quantum Solution

EntangleDE leverages fundamental quantum computing principles to address these challenges:

- **Quantum Superposition**: Enables simultaneous processing of multiple gene expression states
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Naturally models complex relationships between genes
- **Hamiltonian Dynamics**: Provides a physics-based framework for modeling time-dependent gene expression changes
- **Eigenvalue Analysis**: Extracts meaningful patterns from complex expression landscapes

While EntangleDE doesn't require actual quantum hardware (it uses simulators), it applies quantum algorithms and mathematical frameworks that give it unique advantages in capturing complex gene dynamics.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 The Quantum Hamiltonian Approach

The core innovation in EntangleDE is mapping gene expression data to a quantum Hamiltonian framework. In quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian operator (H) represents the total energy of a system and governs its time evolution according to Schrödinger's equation:

$i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi(t)\rangle = H|\psi(t)\rangle$

EntangleDE creates a Hamiltonian matrix where:
- Matrix elements represent transition rates between gene expression states
- The structure encodes how gene expression changes along pseudotime
- Time evolution of this system reveals characteristic patterns (eigenvalues and eigenstates)

### 2.2 Hamiltonian Construction from Gene Expression Data

The process of creating the Hamiltonian follows these mathematical steps:

1. Start with normalized gene expression data matrix E(g,c) where g indexes genes and c indexes cells
2. Sort cells by pseudotime τ
3. Calculate expression changes between consecutive timepoints: ΔE(g) = [E(g,t+1) - E(g,t)]/Δτ
4. Construct the transition matrix H where each element H(i,j) represents how gene j influences the expression change of gene i:
   $H(i,j) = \sum_{t} E(j,t) \cdot \Delta E(i,t)$
5. Ensure Hermiticity (required for valid quantum Hamiltonians) by symmetrizing: H = (H + H†)/2

This Hamiltonian essentially encodes a dynamical model of gene expression regulation, where genes influence each other's expression changes over time.

### 2.3 Quantum Circuit Implementation

To process this Hamiltonian using quantum computing principles, EntangleDE:

1. Performs eigendecomposition of the Hamiltonian: H = VDV†, where D contains eigenvalues
2. Creates a unitary time-evolution operator: U = e^(-iHt) = V e^(-iDt) V†
3. Implements this unitary operator on a quantum circuit using Qiskit
4. Simulates the circuit and collects measurement statistics

The quantum circuit effectively performs time evolution under the gene expression Hamiltonian, revealing which genes show significant dynamical patterns.

## 3. EntangleDE Architecture and Implementation

## 4. Data Flow and Processing Pipeline

### 4.1 Data Preprocessing

EntangleDE applies several preprocessing steps to ensure optimal analysis:

1. **Log transformation**: Applies log1p transformation to handle the skewed nature of expression data
2. **Min-max normalization**: Scales each gene's expression to [0,1] range 
3. **Dimensionality reduction**: Optional PCA step for datasets with many genes
4. **Pseudotime ordering**: Arranges cells in order of biological progression

These steps prepare the data for quantum Hamiltonian embedding by removing technical biases and focusing on biologically relevant patterns.

### 4.2 Quantum Analysis Workflow

The quantum analysis follows these steps:

1. **Hamiltonian construction**: Builds matrix from preprocessed data
2. **Circuit encoding**: Converts Hamiltonian to quantum circuit
3. **Circuit execution**: Runs simulation with multiple measurements
4. **Signature extraction**: Collects eigenvalues and measurement statistics
5. **Gene scoring**: Maps quantum signatures back to gene space

## 5. Mathematical Foundation

### 5.1 Detailed Derivation of Hamiltonian Construction

The Hamiltonian construction follows principles from both dynamical systems and quantum mechanics:

1. **Expression dynamics model**: We model gene expression dynamics as a time-dependent process where genes influence each other's expression rates:
   $\frac{dE_i}{dt} = \sum_j H_{ij} E_j$
   where E_i is the expression of gene i and H_ij represents how gene j influences the rate of change of gene i.

2. **Discretization**: Since single-cell data provides discrete snapshots, we estimate derivatives from finite differences:
   $\frac{dE_i(t)}{dt} \approx \frac{E_i(t+\Delta t) - E_i(t)}{\Delta t}$

3. **Parameter estimation**: The elements of H are estimated from the data by assuming the model holds across pseudotime, leading to the estimator:
   $H_{ij} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^{N-1} E_j(t) \frac{E_i(t+1) - E_i(t)}{\Delta t}$

4. **Hermitization**: To ensure valid quantum properties, we symmetrize:
   $H = \frac{H + H^†}{2}$

This approach effectively treats gene expression as a quantum system evolving according to Schrödinger's equation, allowing us to leverage quantum mechanical properties for analysis.

### 5.2 Eigendecomposition and Feature Extraction

Once the Hamiltonian is constructed, we extract features through eigendecomposition:

1. **Eigendecomposition**: Decompose H into eigenvalues λ and eigenvectors v:
   $H\mathbf{v} = \lambda\mathbf{v}$

2. **Feature relevance**: The eigenvalues represent the strength of different expression patterns

3. **Gene weights**: For each eigenvalue λ_i with eigenvector v_i, the contribution of gene j is:
   $w_j = \sum_i |\lambda_i v_{ij}|$

4. **Score integration**: Combine these weights with expression changes to calculate final scores

This approach identifies genes that contribute significantly to the dominant modes of expression dynamics captured by the eigenvalues.

### 5.3 Time Evolution and Quantum Circuit Simulation

The time evolution under the Hamiltonian is simulated as follows:

1. **Unitary operator**: The time evolution operator is $U(t) = e^{-iHt}$

2. **Eigendecomposition implementation**: Using eigendecomposition H = VDV†, we compute $U(t) = V e^{-iDt} V^†$

3. **Circuit application**: This unitary is applied to the quantum circuit

4. **Measurement**: The circuit is measured multiple times to collect statistics

The parameter t controls the evolution time, with longer times potentially revealing different dynamic patterns.

## 6. Use Cases and Applications

This is particularly relevant for cancer progression, neurodegenerative disorders, and other diseases with distinct stages.

### 6.3 Drug Response Dynamics

By treating time points after drug administration as a trajectory, EntangleDE can analyze:

- **Early response genes**: First genes to respond to treatment
